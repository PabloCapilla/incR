# incR: R package for the analysis of animal incubation

This is a beta version of an R package developed to analyse animal incubation. 
The code and the documentation are being actively updated - check for latest version.

`incR` takes a time-series of incubation temperature, scores incubation and provides
a suite of functions to calculate biologically relevant metrics of incubation.

Please, if you use the package and find bugs or think of any improvement, get in
