## Test environments
* local Windows 10 install, R 3.4.1
* win-builder (devel)
* ubuntu 12.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.0

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was one NOTE in win-builder (devel):

	Maintainer: 'Pablo Capilla-Lasheras <pacapilla@gmail.com>'

	New submission

	Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  		incR (11:20)

No spelling mistake in 11:20, correct package name. And this is, indeed, a new release.

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
