\title{Calculation of the percentage of daily time spent in the nest}
\usage{
incRconstancy(data, vector.incubation)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame containing a time-series vector of 1 and 0, where "1"
means "incubating individual inside nest" and "0" means "incubating individual
outside nest". This vector, 
under the name of "inc.vector" is provided by \code{\link{incRscan}} in the 
first object of the returned list. A column named "date" is needed to refer to daily
calculations.}

\item{vector.incubation}{name of the column (vector class) storing the
information about the presence/absence of the incubating individual in the nest.}
}
\value{
Daily percentage (in 0 to 1 scale) of time in nest. Return in a 
data frame with one day per raw.
}
\description{
This function calculates % of day time spent inside the nest
based on the "inc.vector" produced by \code{\link{incRscan}}.
Current versions do not discriminate day and night times.
