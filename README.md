# incR
Development of an R package for the analysis of avian incubation data and patterns.

This is a very early-version of an R package developed to analyse avian incubation behaviour. The code and the documentation is
currently being actively updated. Please, if you have a look at the code or use the package and you find any bug (you will!), get in 
contact to implement your improvements. I am keen to create a network of collaborators, so don't hesitate to get in touch.
The need for a package like this was first conceived while I was working at the University of Glasgow with Barbara Helm and Davide Dominoni.
