Development of an R package for the analysis of animal incubation

This is a beta version of an R package developed to analyse animal incubation. The code and the documentation are
currently being actively updated. The need for a package like this was first conceived while I was working at the University of Glasgow with Barbara Helm and Davide Dominoni.

Please, if you have a look at the code or use the package and you find any bug (you will!), or think of any improvement, get in 
contact to implement your recommendations. I am keen to collaborate, so don't hesitate to get in touch.

# Updates:
- Version 0.2.0. (2017-06-05):Improvement of documentation.
