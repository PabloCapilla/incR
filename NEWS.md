# incR 2.0.1.9000
* maptools functionality replaced by suncalc

# incR 2.0.0.9000
* New function added, incRscan_v2. This new function applies a fixed temperature threshold to assign on/off-bouts. incRscan_v2 may handle differences in data quality among days worse than the original incRscan function but it recovers on/off-bouts information for every day in the original data set (unlike incRscan which starts the analysis in the first day with complete data).
