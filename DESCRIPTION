Description: 
    At the core of incR lays an algorithm that allows 
    for the scoring of incubation behaviour. Additionally, several functions 
    extract biologically relevant metrics of incubation such as off-bout number 
    and off-bout duration - for a review of avian incubation studies, 
    see "Nest, Eggs and Incubation" (2015) edited by
    D. Charles Deeming and S. James Reynols.
