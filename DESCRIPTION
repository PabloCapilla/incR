Description: incR contains a suite of functions
    that allow the user to manipulate incubation data, in the form
    of temperature time-series. At the core
    of IncR lays an algorithmic function that allows for the classification of
    incubation behaviour. Then, some additional functions allow the user to
    calculate several measures of incubation behaviour. The core algorithm of incR is in
    constant development; however, the additional functions can be still applied whatever
    the core function is, leading to great flexibility and usage.
