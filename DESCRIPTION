Description: incR contains a suite of functions thought for the analysis of avian incubation,
    in the form of temperature time-series. At the core
    of IncR lays an algorithm that allows for the classification of
    incubation behaviour. Then, some additional functions 
    calculate several measures of incubation behaviour.
