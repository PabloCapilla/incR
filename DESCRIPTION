Description: incR contains a suite of functions
    that allow you to manipulate incubation data, in the form
    of temperature (or other variable) time series. At the core
    of IncubationR lays an algorithmic function that allows you to classify
    incubation behaviour. Then, some additional functions allows the user to
    calculate several measures of incubation behaviour.
