#' @title Calculation of the percentage of daily time spent in nest
#' @description This function calculates % of day time spent inside nest
#' based on the "inc.vector" variable produced by \code{\link{incRscan}} (or anyother method).
#' Current version do not discriminate day and night times.
#' @param data data frame containing a time-series vector of 1Â´s and 0's, where "1"
#' means "incubating individual inside nest" and "0" means "incubating individual
#' outside nest". This vector, 
#' under the name of "inc.vector" is provided by \code{\link{incRscan}} in the 
#' first object of the returned list. A column named "date" is needed to refer to daily
#' calculations.
#' @param vector.incubation name of the column (vector class) storing the
#' information about the presence/absence of the incubating individual in the nest.
#' @return Daily percentage of time in nest, returned in a 
#' data frame with one day per raw.
